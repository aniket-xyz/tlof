Someone, someone tell me what theyâ€™re fighting for<br/>
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war<br/>
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive<br/>
Someone, someone, someone tell me why we need it?<br/>
Anyone, anyone, anyone can start a war<br/>
No one can walk away, no one can walk away truly alive

This is just the chorus to the beautiful song by [Anberlin](http://anberlin.com).

## A little on Anberlin and myself

I have been listening to Anberlin for over 5 years now. The first song I head of their's was _The Feel Good Drag_ and then I heard _The Undeveloped Story_, and these two tracks were enough to get me hooked on to them.

There music was so different from the regular Alternate scene happening at that point of time and most of of the music that was coming along was very generic. Anberlin set a trend very different from the usual and have created a space for themselves on the charts.

During this time, I have seen Anberlin mature from a band that was passionate about their music into taking their music to another level where it does set them apart from the rest and even influences other artists.
