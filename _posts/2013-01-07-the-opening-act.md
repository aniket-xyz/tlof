Welcome, to my little project. Let's not even call it a project.

The reason I am starting with this is because a friend of mine wanted me to give her a song a day, so that she develops an interest in music. And I take upon this opportunity to start off a blog, I wanted to make for a long time and now that I have an opportunity and a daily reader for it.
