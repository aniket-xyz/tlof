I am big metal and lyric fan but fell in love with post-rock last semester. And all this happened due to a senior of mine who made me listen to the mellow post-rock.

Today, I wish to introduce one of the many post-rock bands I love and this one is called [65daysofstatic](http://65daysofstatic.com).

I can waste so much time listing out all the tracks that I like by them and why I like them so much, but post-rock is one genre which you need to experience as an album all together. It tells a story, it is inspiring, it is brilliant.
