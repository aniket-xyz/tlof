<blockquote markdown="1">
Are you alone where you are tonight?<br/>
I'm alone when you're right here<br/>
But I'm still in you somehow, I never left at all<br/>
Now I'm still in you too low<br/>
So my voice is all you know

Beautifully crafted heartfelt lyrics I have ever heard but they lasted only for a couple of years. Soon, they faded into the nothingness of this pop-culture. [Evans Blue](http://evansblue.com) is a keeper for me and they will always be remembered.

## The Pursuit

The above written lines might look like a remembrance because they are. Evans Blue is more or less dead to me. Let me take you _a step back_.

Evans Blue has been one of those bands which I will always list out in my top five alternate artists.

They came out with their best releases in the starting years and these were &ndash;
1. The Melody And The Energetic Nature Of Volume
2. The Pursuit Begins When This Portrayal Of Life Ends

The confusing part for me was when their vocalist, Kevin Matisyn left the band in 2008 and their music changed to such an extent that I couldn't bear the change. The band lost all it's charm and grace, and turned into a run-off-the-mill alternate rock band with no inspiration in their music.

## My other loved tracks by them

* In A Red Dress And Alone
* My Damsel: A Confession To An Adversary
* Painted
* The Pursuit
* Buried Alive
* A Step Back
* Bulletproof

^ Include the entirety of _The Melody And The Energetic Nature Of Volume_ as it's their best work till date.

## Note

The title of the post is from their self-titled release which came out after Kevin left Evans Blue.
The post has a greater portion of it based on my personal opinion and your taste shouldn't be affected by my choice.
