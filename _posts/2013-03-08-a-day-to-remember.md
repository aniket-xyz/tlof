You can call their music so many things but in their hearts they are still punk. [A Day To Remember](http://adtr.com) is of the very few post-hardcore acts around, which have inspiring, positive lyrics and a heavy sound. Combining the elements of metalcore and pop-punk in their music, they have created a very different style of their's.

They have four full length albums out so far and I give you in writing that **you should listen to them** if you don't. For me their best creation till date is _Homesick_.
