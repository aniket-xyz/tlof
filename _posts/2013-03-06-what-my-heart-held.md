I feel like I'm stuck in this routine
Every day is decided before I wake
Every dream that I've dreamt I don't want to chase
All the people I've met, I start forgetting their names

A lyric lover will always be able to appreciate the sheer genius of [We Came As Romans](http://wecameasromans.com) for the contribution they did to the post-hardcore scene. I still haven't heard their latest single _Hope_ and I fell in love with their last release only a couple of days back, for which I am really sad.

The first time I heard their music was when I came across their first EP titled _Dreams_ and the opening track was enough for me to get hooked on to their style. They had slight orchestraic feel to their music and strong lyrics, and not forgetting the screams to make you make a move. After their first album I had a strong attachment to their music. To Plant A Seed was a scene changer that time because of the variant of post-hardcore they brought along.
