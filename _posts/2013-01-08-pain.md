Pain, without love<br/>
Pain, I can't get enough<br/>
Pain, I like it rough<br/>
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

I rather not comment on the lyrics above but rather tell you more about [Three Days Grace](http://www.threedaysgrace.com).

## How I got hooked onto them?

From what I can remember, it was 2005 when I first heard of them and for some odd reason, their name was very close to Three Doors Down. And I thought they might not be that great.

[Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NQ8OCcQ3LA) was enough for me to start loving them. They were the perfect band for me at that point. In the last 7 years there music has changed so drastically. Their old style comprised of some brilliant lyrics and good breakdowns, but now they have those guitar solos in most of their tracks that get a bit irritating.
