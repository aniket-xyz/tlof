<blockquote markdown="1">
Are you listening?<br/>
We write a thousand pages, they're torn and on the floor.<br/>
Headlights hammer the windows, we're locked behind these doors.<br/>
And we are never leaving, this place is part of us.<br/>
And all these scenes repeating are cold to the touch.

A friend of mine said this a couple of days ago, "Happy people listen to the music. Sad people listen to the lyrics." I don't support what he said even a little because it doesn't make sense. The effort of any artist goes in the music and the lyrics are equally important because they shape the music.

Regardless, let me introduce you to [Emery](http://www.last.fm/music/Emery). If you are intro lyrics and an interesting vocal style, then you need to listen to all their songs. And by all their songs, listen to each and everyone of them because they have so much to give.

I don't want to put in a track list. Discover music they way it's meant to be done.

I drove these streets to your front door,<br/>
so could you please just help me out?<br/>
It's sad to say but there's always more,<br/>
and you just stare like you can't hear us out.
