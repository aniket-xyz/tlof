The above written words are by [Chevelle](http://chevelleinc.com) and they are one of those bands that I respect from my heart. Their music is the most brilliant stuff I have heard in years and they still continue to come out with some mind-blowing releases.

## Same Old Trip

Chevelle has the most amazing lyric work among the bands in their genre, but there's only one thing with it, that it sometimes (mostly) doesn't make sense.

Regardless, you should definitely give them a shot if you like _alternate metal_ and _hard rock_. Even if you don't like those two genres, you should listen to them if you like some interesting lyrics, because these guys are brilliant.

## My other loved tracks by them

* Point #1
* The Red
* The Clincher
* Vitamin R (Leading Us Along)
* Get Some
* Well Enough Alone
* The Fad

Apart from the tracks mentioned above, include both of their last releases i.e. _Sci-Fi Crimes_ and _Hats Off to the Bull_.
