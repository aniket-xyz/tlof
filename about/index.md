## Why the name?
Four years back when I was in school, a friend of mine and I were trying to come up with band names of our own. And I came up with two &ndash; one was _Board My Sinking Ship_ and the other was this, _Thousand Lamps on Fire_.

It was been stuck with me for a couple of years now and I wanted to bring in into the picture someday and seems like a great addition over here.

## Why did I start this?
A friend of mine who goes by the name of [@thecalmsun](https://twitter.com/thecalmsun) on twitter wanted some inspiration in music, and this is where I came in.

## What is this all about?
I am going to put in one post daily on a song, the artist and my journey with their music over a few years. It seems like a great way to introduce someone to new genres of music and that's a great thing.

##So, what all do I like?
I'm into post-hardcore, rock, metalcore, instrumental and post-rock, including:
